/**
 *   Use `Polymer.IronOverlayBehavior` to implement an element that can be hidden or shown, and displays
 *   on top of other content. It includes an optional backdrop, and can be used to implement a variety
 *   of UI controls including dialogs and drop downs. Multiple overlays may be displayed at once.
 *   See the [demo source code](https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-overlay-behavior/blob/master/demo/simple-overlay.html)
 *   for an example.
 *   ### Closing and canceling
 *   An overlay may be hidden by closing or canceling. The difference between close and cancel is user
 *   intent. Closing generally implies that the user acknowledged the content on the overlay. By default,
 *   it will cancel whenever the user taps outside it or presses the escape key. This behavior is
 *   configurable with the `no-cancel-on-esc-key` and the `no-cancel-on-outside-click` properties.
 *   `close()` should be called explicitly by the implementer when the user interacts with a control
 *   in the overlay element. When the dialog is canceled, the overlay fires an 'iron-overlay-canceled'
 *   event. Call `preventDefault` on this event to prevent the overlay from closing.
 *   ### Positioning
 *   By default the element is sized and positioned to fit and centered inside the window. You can
 *   position and size it manually using CSS. See `Polymer.IronFitBehavior`.
 *   ### Backdrop
 *   Set the `with-backdrop` attribute to display a backdrop behind the overlay. The backdrop is
 *   appended to `<body>` and is of type `<iron-overlay-backdrop>`. See its doc page for styling
 *   options.
 *   In addition, `with-backdrop` will wrap the focus within the content in the light DOM.
 *   Override the [`_focusableNodes` getter](#Polymer.IronOverlayBehavior:property-_focusableNodes)
 *   to achieve a different behavior.
 *   ### Limitations
 *   The element is styled to appear on top of other content by setting its `z-index` property. You
 *   must ensure no element has a stacking context with a higher `z-index` than its parent stacking
 *   context. You should place this element as a child of `<body>` whenever possible.
 *
